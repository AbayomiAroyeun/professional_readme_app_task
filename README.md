# Professional README
The common needs and pains in writting a standard README file for projects , assigments and research works was the pressing factor for creating this app,
"Prefessional README App".So, getting something readily available for users was a strong desire.It affords the users, a platform to have a professional Readme file for their need. It saves financial and time resources in soughting for a file that meet the needs.
In the course of the developemnt of this Application , a lot was learnt which include but not linmited to;
- Reasearch work really takes a lot of time resources, hence there is need to remain organised and focused, keeping to the pre designed itinerary of activities.
- There are so many resources available to use but getting a perfect one is a big task.
## challenges:
Project of this nature never comes without challeges, from timing to validity and geneuity of accurate data and resources. Many reources are not free to come by
## Improvement:
There is hope to be improve in future on this Application as things can always be done better. Various contribution towards this improvement are also welcomed.
